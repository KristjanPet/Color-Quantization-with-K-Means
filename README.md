# Image Posterization

This project implements a simple image posterization algorithm using Python and NumPy. It clusters similar pixel colors in an image and assigns them a common color, creating a posterization effect. It utilizes k-means clustering to achieve this effect.

## Features

- Image posterization using k-means clustering.
- Random initialization of cluster centers.
- Visualization of the original and posterized images.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Replace `'beach.jpg'` in the code with the path to your input image.
4. Set the desired number of clusters `k`.
5. Run the Python script to perform image posterization.
6. View the original and posterized images using OpenCV.
